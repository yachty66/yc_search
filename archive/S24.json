Organizations have little incentive to grow these teams, which leads to burnout and inefficiency.\n\nKairo scales this support staff by recording their actions and translating them into instructions for our agents to execute on their own. Organizations can deploy these agents for any care delivery workflow, such as calling patients to check-in on their symptoms, rescheduling a clinician\u2019s panel in case of an emergency, and filling late cancellation slots with other patients.",

Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM\u2014traditionally scattered across multiple systems\u2014into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for.\n\nWe reduce\n\n- Manual work by 60%\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\n- Complete projects 3x faster.\n\nWhy Now?\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\n\nTeam:\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that\u2019s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.\n\u2022 Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.\n\u2022 Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.\n\u2022 All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.\n\u2022 Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\n\u2022 On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.\n\u2022 And more...\n\nAll the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization.",

For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.\n\nBy selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of \u2014 things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire \u2014 imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire.\n\nThousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned.",

The most trusted brand in political news and analysis, Politico, chose us to power their Politico Pro Subscription product.\n\nConsumers expect instant personalized answers. Publishers won\u2019t build this on their own.\n\nCapitol\u2019s API lights up publishers' websites and apps so their end users can generate personalized search results, cited research reports, and even tweet storms using the publisher\u2019s proprietary data\u2014all within their paywall.\n\nCapitol is the new last mile of content delivery for publishing. This market is $16b in 2023, and will grow to $85.6b in 2030.\n\nGemini and Perplexity are the imperial forces. Capitol is arming the rebels.",

        "description": "Mica builds AI Agents that automate B2B sales. Our agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral, and follow up until the deal is closed.\n\nThe founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren\u2019t just great at selling\u2014they were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies.\n\nHowever, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.\n\nMica\u2019s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.\n\nSales collateral creation and follow-up is a $11b market in the US but this is just our beachhead. We\u2019ll ship a fleet of agents that automate and eventually replace every other facet of the $80b enterprise sales market.",

With Pipeshift, companies making >1000 calls/day on frontier LLMs can use their data and logs to replace GPT/Claude in production with specialized LLMs that offer higher accuracy, lower latencies, and model ownership.\n\nWe are experts in LLMs, having scaled LLMs to 1000s of users in 2023. That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.\n\nThe shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.\n\nPipeshift offers this stack out of the box. With our fine-tuning + distilling platform and one-click deployment stack for hosting these LLMs, we ensure 10x faster experimentation cycles and time-to-production. Think \"Vercel for open-source LLMs\".",

The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation.

On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses.\n\nWith trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike.\n\nOway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before. We also improve the survivability of independent truckers by maximizing their revenue when they\u2019re already on the road - and it\u2019s great for the environment too. \ud83c\udf43",

With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.\n\nWhy us?

As the AI Executor, we manage the entire estate transfer process, facilitating $3 trillion in wealth transfers annually, with a ~3% take rate.\n\nAdria experienced this challenge firsthand after her mom passed away, leaving her to settle the estate while balancing her career. The process is currently entirely manual and takes an average of 400 hours over 18 months. Adria eventually burned out and resigned, which is when she realized that bereavement costs businesses $100 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and attrition.\n\nBy addressing this problem through businesses, Elayne generates recurring revenue in an industry traditionally reliant on 1x transactions, while maintaining a lasting presence in the end user\u2019s life. We directly alleviate the 43% increase in attrition following the death of a family member, while reducing overall costs for grieving families, democratizing estate support, and saving users hundreds of hours in financial, legal, and administrative tasks per loss.",

        "description": "Mindely is the first AI interviewer designed for skills assessment interviews.\n\nHiring for high volume, high turnover roles (e.g., consultants, analysts, sales & customer representatives) is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to unconscious bias. Managers spend valuable time on lengthy skill-based interviews instead of focusing on building candidate relationships or on driving company revenue.\n\nTraditional AI interviewers don\u2019t solve these issues \u2013 their rigid Q&A formats and one-size-fits-all approach can\u2019t handle complex skill assessments. Mindely changes the game as the first AI interviewer built for in-depth case study, technical and role-play interviews. It:\n- Simulates human interaction with real-time dialogue\n- Challenges candidates with dynamic, adaptive responses\n- Eliminates interviewer bias to create a fair, inclusive hiring process\n- Works 24/7 to free up senior staff and widen talent pool\n\nWith Mindely, companies can rapidly customize and deploy human interviews at AI scale to test specific on-the-job skills.",

Companies like Lull.com and Dutch.com are using our platform to improve their consumer experience and retention.\n\nAlex and Tyler met at a high-growth E-Commerce startup where Tyler was running Technology & Data. Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to $100MM in Revenue.\n\nAlex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple AI features. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.\n\nVoker is built for product specialists who know they can delight their users with AI but can't spend engineering bandwidth on building those features. By making AI accessible and practical, Voker helps these businesses profit from this new wave of innovation.",

        "description": "At Moreta, we simplify payments for international travelers, letting you pay for anything using just your phone. Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the best cash exchange rates or ATMs on your next trip. With Moreta, paying local merchants is easy, and the best part? Transparent fees.\n\nWe came up with Moreta while on our own backpacking adventures. Watching locals pay with a simple scan while we fumbled with cards and cash. So, we created a solution. By syncing with local payment networks, Moreta lets you pay like a local\u2014securely and digitally\u2014without needing a bank account in every country.\n\nWe\u2019re starting in Asia, where QR code digital wallets are taking over and are now the top choice at checkout. As these wallets start to join forces for cross-border payments, Moreta will be the first to bridge the gap for international travelers from card-centric markets to seamlessly tap into these local networks. Moreta will target 67 million travelers arriving in the region each year, who together have $127 billion in everyday expenditure.",

By combining top industry expertise with the latest in AI and fintech, we provide real-time financial insights, strategic community planning, and automated operations.\n\nLike many homeowners, Shreyas and Allen experienced frustrations with HOAs. Our investigation revealed that most HOA management companies are outdated mom-and-pop operations nearing retirement, resistant to adopting new technology. Furthermore, these companies often prioritize relationships with vendors and banks over the interests of the communities they serve, leading to misaligned incentives. Realizing this, we knew that to achieve our mission of fixing HOAs, Assembly HOA had to be vertically integrated.\n\nWe are live with over 39 communities in Greater Los Angeles and SF Bay Area.",

        "description": "With autarc we are building the OS for Europe's One-Stop Energy Installers. We are live with 400 customers and an ARR of $1.4 million.\n\nThe problem: Energy installers are eager to expand their deployment of heat pump and photovoltaic systems, yet they are constrained by inefficient sales, planning, and installation processes.\n\nThe solution: Our B2B software integrates CRM, planning, and design tools into a unified platform. This enables SMB installers to drastically cut down the pre-installation phase of home energy projects\u2014from several weeks to just minutes. By leveraging LiDAR for spatial analysis, computer vision for automated assessment, and AI for system recommendations, we streamline the entire workflow. This results in a time reduction of up to 90%, enabling installers to confidently transition to and scale up sustainable home energy solutions.",

At Alt, we were faced with the manual workflows from compliance to servicing that are needed to make and manage consumer loans. And as a result, we spent much of our time and hundreds of thousands of dollars creating robust internal tooling to ensure we were doing things the right way.\n\nHowever, after the pain of hunting through regulatory codes, confusion of form filling, surprise of regulatory deadlines, monotony of PDF data extraction, anxiety of brittle excel spreadsheets, the frustration of buried email threads with advisors, and the missed phone calls with borrowers to chase payments \u2026 to name a few \u2026 we knew that this experience needed to be improved.\n\nSo, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.\n\nFinsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with: outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.\n\nThe operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business \u2013 we are changing that.",

It's now possible to build a voice interface that passes the threshold for a great customer experience.\n\nIn the United States, there are 200,000 Drive-Thrus handling 6 Billion visits a year. At 3 minutes per order, that's 34,000 human years spent on taking orders annually.

Instead of relying on humans to quote, take orders, collect payments, place purchase orders and enter data into ERPs. We build AI Employees that do these manual repetitive tasks for the 700k wholesalers in the US.\n\nWe\u2019re a team of three Computer Science majors, and Fernando launched and grew AT&T in Mexico to $120M ARR. Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.\n\nWe realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.",

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\n\n\nOur Approach:\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

        "description": "1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes.\n\nUnfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can\u2019t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.\n\nWhile a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves.\n\nTo change that, we\u2019re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.\n\nWe\u2019re world class microbial engineers. We met while doing our PhDs in synthetic biology, where we spent our time applying and developing the most advanced bioengineering technologies to engineer living cells.",

        "description": "Olive uses AI to summarize client medical records for personal injury lawyers. We're at $13k MRR after launching eight weeks ago, and law firms choose us because we double paralegal efficiency. As we take over more legal workflow, Olive will serve victims of medical malpractice directly.\n\nSam's ex-girlfriend introduced him to Greg back at CMU in 2017, and while that relationship didn't last, their friendship has. After undergrad, Greg went to Harvard Law School, while Sam worked for three years at Jane Street, building & leading a satellite dev team.\n\nGreg graduated, Sam quit, and we founded Olive with a big idea: use AI to make the law more accessible. We started with AI in corporate law given Greg's background, but quickly realized the space was crowded, and turned our attention to the under-competed $65B personal injury market.\n\nAI disruption makes a lot of sense in personal injury because the incentives are aligned\u2014plaintiff lawyers are paid on contingency, and therefore love time-saving tools. We have competitors who have proven substantial demand for medical summaries, but they operate at best on hybrid human/AI approaches with multi-day turnarounds. We think there's space for an AI solution that cuts humans out of the loop entirely, and we think we're the right team to do it.\n\nWe're focusing on the medical malpractice niche within personal injury, because there's a massive access to justice problem: medical malpractice lawyers decline most cases under $500k since they're too expensive to litigate. An estimated 80% of medical malpractice victims can't secure representation right now. We estimate this latent demand at $48bn/year.\n\nWe are on a mission to unlock this value.",

We ran into this problem time and time again as our startups began to scale.\n\n\nWe're now working with a wide range of companies, including a number of multi-billion $ enterprises. Our open source tooling also has ~1k stars on GitHub, over 400k downloads, and is in use by Nvidia.\n\n\nIn the short term, Gauge is building tools to modularize the monolith. Long term, Gauge is building a way to deploy a single codebase as a set of independent services, giving you the scalability of microservices alongside the simplicity of monolithic development.",

Together, we built the first real-time, warehouse-native customer data platform. Prior to that, Dom led 20+ ML engineers at Adobe to build their internal ad optimization platform, which allocates $1B in annual spend. Ben built the microservices stack powering the new Microsoft Edge, scaling from 0 to hundreds of millions of DAUs.\n\nWe started coding Snowpilot in mid-August '24, and we already have a live app that can run sub-second queries on millions of rows, entirely in the user's browser.\n\nThe data warehouse market is $10B/yr, growing 23% YOY. We will disrupt incumbents and significantly expand this market by enabling non-engineers to use big data on a daily basis.",

For example, if a user asked an AI agent to buy a book on an e-commerce site, we handle the purchase via our Purchasing API.\n\nAI agents are poised to elevate the way we shop, but they aren\u2019t reliably making purchases today. We\u2019re changing that by bringing uniformity to non-uniform checkout flows across the internet.\n\nOur expertise is at the intersection of payments and e-commerce. Angelica was a staff engineer at Stripe, driving API evolution, design, and governance across payments products. Scott was a senior investor at Sycamore Partners, investing in and partnering with leading consumer companies.\n\nOur solution will enable AI agents to make payments of every kind, including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), consumer services (e.g., Uber, DoorDash), and B2B (e.g., supplier payment). In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us. We have already onboarded multiple AI agent customers who have thousands of monthly users and have begun integrating them to power their e-commerce purchases.",

        "description": "With AI increasingly automating away code generation, software engineers will spend more time reading, judging, and architecting code rather than writing it. Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\n\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\n1) Given my project\u2019s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\n\nSage\u2019s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\n\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren\u2019t going to cut it.\n\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called \u201cRAG\u201d (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.",

We generate revenue by charging when electricity is cheap and discharging when electricity is expensive.\n\nWe rent battery storage for a fixed fee per month, and we earn 2x that fee in monthly revenue by dispatching the battery optimally.\n\nToday, power companies use human traders to manually track grid conditions and update the battery\u2019s dispatch schedule. However batteries can adjust their power output 100x faster than traditional power generation (e.g. hydro, coal, nuclear, gas), with the ability to go from full-speed charging to to full speed discharging in under a minute. Electricity prices change every 5 minutes, often by 300% or more.

        "description": "Azalea Robotics automates airport baggage handling with intelligent robot operations. The global market for airport baggage handling systems is $20+ billion and growing, presenting a significant opportunity for innovation and market disruption in this sector.\n\n\nPassenger air traffic volume is increasing, driving demand for efficient and reliable baggage handling at airports and putting immense pressure on existing infrastructure. In 2023 alone, airports processed approximately 4.5 billion bags, highlighting the need for advanced solutions to manage this load effectively. Azalea Robotics provides state-of-the-art robotic systems that enhance efficiency, reduce mishandling, and improve passenger experience through more reliable operations.\n\n\nBaggage handling is a critical component of airline ground operations, yet it is fraught with challenges. The work is physically demanding, often leading to long-term injuries among workers. Traditional baggage handling involves repetitive lifting and maneuvering of heavy loads, which can result in long-term health issues. Azalea Robotics addresses these challenges by automating the most strenuous tasks, thereby reducing the risk of injury and enhancing operational efficiency.",

        "description": "Moonglow connects local Jupyter notebooks to remote cloud compute. Machine learning researchers and data scientists use us to scale up their experiments without having to do DevOps.\n\nPreviously, Leila was a software engineer at Jane Street. She led the build-out of its equities clearinghouse connectivity infrastructure and was the technical lead of its front-office SRE team. Trevor was part of Hazy Research Lab at Stanford, and published machine learning research at NeurIPS, ICLR and ACL.\n\nWith the explosive growth of deep learning, there are over 1 million ML researchers who do computationally intensive experiments every day. They use Jupyter notebooks to do so, but every time they want to try out a new idea, they need to get the notebooks running on cloud machines. This process, repeated hundreds of times a month, is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nMoonglow reliably brings the time-to-experiment down from 5 minutes to 20 seconds. Just as Vercel and Replit abstracted away the lower levels of the computing stack for web developers and programmers, we do the same for ML researchers.\n\nhttps://moonglow.ai",

We think a majority of these will be handled by AI built by thousands of companies tackling every single vertical.\n\nMaking these AI voice agents reliable is hard. A small change in prompts, function call definitions, or model providers can cause large changes in LLM outputs.\n\nHamming automates testing for AI voice agents. Our voice agents call your voice agent. An AI drive-through startup uses Hamming to simulate thousands of simultaneous phone calls to achieve 99.99% agent order accuracy.\n\nWe have a proven track record of helping enterprises win with AI. Sumanyu (CEO) previously helped Citizen (safety app) grow its users by 4X and grew an AI-powered sales program to 100s of millions in revenue/year at Tesla. Marius (CTO) previously ran data infrastructure @ Anduril and was a founding engineer @ Spell (MLOps startup acquired by Reddit).",

Users press a button in their browser and their card-on-file everywhere instantly switches to their shiny new card (our partner's card!).\n\n\ud83d\ude0c Making Checkout Seamless\n\n- Our fast checkout technology embeds \u201cOne Tap Checkout \u201d on the checkout page at over 50,000 e-commerce sites - making our partners' cards the easiest way for users to complete any transaction on their browser.\n- They can even customize the copy to tell the user why to use your card for that specific purchase. For example Chase could prompt their users to use their Sapphire Preferred card on Avis BECAUSE it offers car rental insurance.\n\n\ud83e\udd11 Making Our Partners' Cards More Rewarding\n- We partner with over 1000 of the country\u2019s top merchants to offer additional affiliate-based cash back that our partners can tack on to their existing cash back. User can now earn double or even triple the cash back on Sephora when they user our partners' \u201cOne Tap Checkout\u201d button instead of their other cards.",

We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\n\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting. We have published the first molecule water solubility results with accuracy within the error range of wet lab experiments. We have also kicked-off a 150K pilot project with a pharma company to apply our tech to estimating solubility in their drug development pipeline.",

        "description": "We are building the next generation of deep-learning models for enzyme design to slash the cost of chemical manufacturing. The $6 trillion chemical industry is flawed: It produces 20% of industrial greenhouse gases, and is responsible for 15% of global energy usage.\n\nEnzymes offer a far more sustainable alternative to chemical synthesis and have already revolutionised how a select few chemicals are produced. The problem is each enzyme takes years of trial and error to develop. Our enzyme models learn the principles of catalysis, allowing us to design enzymes for each reaction, in days not years.\n\nWe currently have $4.3M of LOIs and have completed our first $20k contract.",
