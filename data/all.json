We increase revenue by 5x for EV charger owners and enable instant fleet electrification at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOwners of EV chargers get <10% utilization after paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to install, and distributed fleets are rapidly trying to electrify yet charging is a huge bottleneck. Curo is a Virtual Depot platform enabling fleets to long-term lease underutilized EV chargers from owners.\n\nWe're live across CA, NY and WA and have grown 100% MoM for the past 4 months. Curo is already backed by investors like Blue Bear, Not Boring, Slow and Eniac.",

This saves you time and makes Manicode respond more comprehensively.\n- **It takes 0 clicks**\u00a0\u2014 type your instructions and Manicode will edit your files directly. It's simple and fast. Theoretically, you can do all your development by just chatting with it!\n- **It has full access to your terminal**\u00a0\u2014 Manicode can run terminal commands to install packages, run tests, check for type errors, etc. Manicode is an engineer working for you.",

It seamlessly handles customer calls\u2014whether for appointments, service details, availability, or more\u2014offering a natural, human-like experience 24/7.\n\nWhat sets Sandra apart is its deep integration with dealership management systems, allowing it to manage even the most complex queries. This ensures no calls or leads are missed, boosting both customer satisfaction and team efficiency.\n\nThe car dealership industry handles over 3 billion calls annually, with each call averaging 4 to 6 minutes. Traditional call centers charge between $1 and $2 per minute, depending on the complexity of the service. Thus, we estimate the total addressable market for inbound calls alone to exceed $26 billion a year. This does not even account for future opportunities in outbound calls.\n\nBefore launching Sandra, the founding team spent years working in the automotive and call center industries during their time at McKinsey. The three co-founders graduated in Data Science and AI from institutions like MIT, Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris.",

        "description": "PearAI is an open source AI code editor. Think a better GitHub Copilot, or an open source and extendable Cursor... But it's much more than that.\n\n[Context]\nPearAI is becoming a curator of the best AI tools available. We started off with integrating Continue for our AI chat, and we're now integrating more AI tooling which serve different layers of the AI tech stack. This is called the PearAI Inventory, which holds all the AI tooling available.\n\n[Problem Statement]\n- Developers have other needs which a simple AI chat itself does not satisfy, necessitating them to still rely on other AI tools, such as Perplexity, mem0, v0, etc. There are many useful layers of the AI tech stack (e.g. code generation, applying edits, file generation, up-to-date AI search, RAG, terminal, personalization/memory, deployment, image generation, voice, etc.), and not all are currently satisfied by existing AI editors, which mostly try to be a one-size-fit-all solution.\n- Most developers do not know what the latest AI tools are, or how to use them. Even if they know, the latest AI tools constantly update, and change very fast, it\u2019s difficult for the average developer to stay up to date (most developers still use the unpaid version of ChatGPT!).\n- For power users of AI tools, which are a small minority, they have to subscribe to multiple AI tools (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.), each that do better at specific use cases. This causes overspending, additional context switching during workflows, and simply the inconvenience of managing multiple not fully utilized pricy subscriptions.\n- Enterprises also require more privacy safety which closed source AI tooling does not provide. We have already seen many companies express this concern, and that an open source version would be much safer.\n\n[Solution]\n- Each layer of the AI tech stack has existing products fully dedicated to perfecting those specific layers. We integrate the best ones for each layer into PearAI, creating the most useful, and effortless user experience one can have with AI coding.\n- PearAI is open source, allowing AI integrations to be easier, and the active community to help support it. This also helps with privacy, as enterprises can see that their data is not being stored from the app.\n\nExisting users have expressed an up to 5x speed up for their development workflow.

        "description": "Lightscreen is an interactive AI interview experience -- a different approach than other screening tools that unlocks greater insight into a candidate's engineering fundamentals and critical thinking skills. Engineering teams use Lightscreen to expand the number of candidates they can screen, eliminate bias, decrease the number of steps in their interview process, and decrease time-to-fill on technical roles.",
